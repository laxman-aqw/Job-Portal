Full Stack Job Portal Website

In this project, we will build a Full Stack Job Portal using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The platform will allow job seekers to:

- Search for job openings
- Manage profile information
- Apply for jobs online
- Upload their resume to their profile

Additionally, we will create a Recruiter Dashboard where recruiters can:

- Post new job openings
- Manage their published job posts
- Review and manage applications
- Accept or reject job applications
- View applicants' resumes
- Manage profile information
