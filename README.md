In this project, I have built a Full Stack Job Portal using the MERN stack ‚Äî MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This platform is designed to streamline the job search and application process for job seekers by offering the following core features:

üîç Key Features for Job Seekers:
Search for Job Openings: Users can browse and search for jobs using various filters like location, category, and job type.

Apply for Jobs Online: Applicants can apply for jobs directly through the portal with just a few clicks.

Resume Upload & Profile Management: Job seekers can create their profile and upload their resumes to make applying faster and easier.

ü§ñ Job Recommendation System:
To enhance the user experience, I have implemented a naive algorithm to recommend jobs to users based on basic keyword matching from their uploaded resumes and profile information. This simple yet effective recommendation system helps users discover relevant opportunities without needing to search manually.
